# Changelog

All notable changes to Nimbus Weather are documented here.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Custom Alert Rules** — user-defined weather threshold notifications. Create rules like "notify me if today's high > 32°C" or "alert when wind gusts exceed 50 km/h in the next 12 hours." Five supported metrics: today's high, tonight's low, wind gust (12h), precipitation sum (24h), and UV peak. Each rule is independently toggleable and stores thresholds in canonical metric units; the UI converts to the user's preferred display units (°F, mph, inches, etc.) at the Compose layer.
- **`CustomAlertsScreen`** — dedicated screen accessible from Settings > Alerts > Custom Alert Rules. Full CRUD: add rules via FAB, edit via tap, toggle/delete per-row. Bottom-sheet editor with metric chip selector, operator picker (above/below), numeric threshold input, and enable toggle.
- **`CustomAlertWorker`** — hourly periodic CoroutineWorker that evaluates enabled rules against the latest forecast for the user's last-known location. Dedupe per (rule-id, calendar date) via SharedPreferences-backed seen-set, pruned to 7 days. Network-constrained with exponential backoff.
- **`CustomAlertEvaluator`** — pure-function evaluator: resolves each metric from `WeatherData` (daily high/low, hourly wind gusts, 24h precip sum, daily UV max), applies the operator/threshold, and returns triggered hits with observed values.
- **`CHANNEL_CUSTOM` notification channel** — separate "Custom Alerts" channel so users can silence custom rules without losing severe weather or nowcast notifications. Per-rule stable notification IDs prevent clobbering.
- **Startup sync** — `NimbusApplication.onCreate` now schedules/cancels `CustomAlertWorker` based on whether any enabled custom rules exist.
- **Adaptive icon monochrome layer** — launcher icons updated to include `ic_launcher_monochrome` for Material You themed icons on Android 13+.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Proactive precipitation nowcasting notifications** — "Rain in about 15 min", "Rain stopping soon", etc. The existing (but previously unwired) `nowcastingAlerts` preference now schedules a `NowcastAlertWorker` that runs every 15 minutes, pulls the last-known location, fetches the minutely-15 precipitation series, and checks for the first dry→wet or wet→dry transition within a 60-minute window. Title and intensity (light/steady/heavy) are derived from the peak mm value in the incoming wet run.
- **`CHANNEL_NOWCAST` notification channel** — default importance (sound but no DND bypass), its own user-facing "Rain Nowcast" label under the existing Weather Alerts group.
- **Dedupe + cooldown** — transition signature (`start:<timestamp>` or `stop:<timestamp>`) is persisted in a new `nimbus_nowcast_alerts` SharedPreferences file. The same bucket never notifies twice, and a 45-minute minimum gap between any two back-to-back nowcast notifications guards against flip-flop storms spamming the shade.
- **Settings wiring** — toggling "Nowcasting alerts" in Settings now schedules/cancels the worker immediately (previously the toggle only wrote the pref). Flow is permission-gated by the same `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` prompt used for other alert toggles.
- **Startup sync** — `NimbusApplication.onCreate` now reschedules the nowcast worker based on current settings alongside the existing `AlertCheckWorker` sync.

### Tests
- `NowcastAlertLogicTest` — 8 pure-function tests covering empty input, uniformly dry / uniformly wet series (no transition), rain-starting with peak intensity detection, rain-stopping, look-ahead window exclusion (transitions beyond 60 min are ignored), first-transition-only semantics, and notification signature stability across peak-intensity revisions (so a sharpening peak doesn't re-notify).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **"On This Day" card** (28th dynamic card). Surfaces historical weather context for the current calendar date and location:
  - 10-year average high temperature for this date at this location, with a color-coded delta badge comparing today's forecast high (amber = warmer than normal, blue = cooler, neutral = near normal).
  - Record high and record low for this date over the sampled window.
  - Prior-year highs rendered as a 52dp sparkline with an average-line guideline and year tick labels at both ends.
  - Polite empty state when the archive has no usable observations (polar regions, brand-new settlements, first run without network and no cache).
  - TalkBack: sparkline carries a semantic `contentDescription` describing the temperature range.
- **Open-Meteo Archive integration**. New `OpenMeteoArchiveApi` Retrofit interface against `archive-api.open-meteo.com`, wired through a new `@Named("archive")` Retrofit in `NetworkModule`.
- **Immutable historical cache**. `OnThisDayRepository` persists responses in a dedicated `nimbus_on_this_day` SharedPreferences file, keyed by `lat,lon,MM-dd` with `Locale.US` formatting (following the v1.6.5 locale-safe cache-key pattern). Historical observations don't change once logged, so there is no TTL — first access per (location, date) costs one archive call; every subsequent access is instant and offline-safe.
- `CardType.ON_THIS_DAY` — disabled by default; users enable it via the existing Settings card-order screen.

## [1.6.5] - 2026-04-11

Third QA audit pass focused on card composables, charts, accessibility, theme, and data-parsing robustness. 27 findings raised, 25 rejected as false positives (already-guarded divide-by-zeros, already-clamped path math, semantic AQI colors that follow EPA standards and shouldn't be themed). 2 latent i18n bugs confirmed and fixed.

### Fixed
- **NWS alert requests malformed on comma-decimal locales** — `NwsAlertAdapter` built its request point via `"%.4f,%.4f".format(lat, lon)` using the default locale. On de_DE / fr_FR / es_ES and similar locales, this produces `"39,7392,-104,9847"` — comma-decimal output that the NWS API parses as four fields and rejects. The adapter now uses `String.format(Locale.US, ...)` explicitly. Regression test added (`getAlertsFormatsPointWithDotDecimalOnLocalesThatUseCommaDecimal`).
- **NWS HTTP error handling fragile to Retrofit message-format changes** — `NwsAlertAdapter` detected the "non-US coordinates → 404" case via `e.message?.contains("404")`, which breaks if Retrofit's exception message format ever changes. The adapter now catches `retrofit2.HttpException` and inspects `e.code()` directly. All other exceptions still propagate as `Result.failure`.
- **Weather cache key locale-dependent** — `WeatherCacheEntity.makeKey` formatted lat/lon with default locale, producing locale-dependent cache keys (`"39,74,-104,99"` on a German device vs `"39.74,-104.99"` elsewhere). Cache reads stayed consistent *within* a locale, but if the user ever changed device locale, every existing cache entry became unreachable. Now pinned to `Locale.US`.

### Audit findings rejected (verified against real code)
- `PrecipitationChartCard` divide-by-zero — `if (data.isEmpty()) return` on line 42 + `if (maxProb > 0)` on line 90 already guard the Canvas
- `MoonPhaseCard` illFraction clamping — already `.coerceIn(0.0, 1.0)` on line 136
- `VisibilityCard` thresholds bounds — list has 7 elements, loop `for (i in 0 until 6)` accesses indices 0–6 safely
- `UvIndexBar` divide-by-zero — gated by `if (uvIndex >= 1)` on line 88
- `AqiGauge` hardcoded colors break AMOLED — colors are semantic EPA AQI tiers and shouldn't be themed away
- 10+ other hardcoded-color findings — semantic data colors, not UI chrome
- `WeatherWallpaperService` paint.alpha clamping — particle spawn caps alpha at 0.5; multiplied by 255 = max 127
- `NwsAlertAdapter` `e.message.contains` issue — **confirmed and fixed above**
- Various `contentDescription = null` on decorative icons — intentional
- `WeatherWallpaperService` frame rate hardcoded 30 fps — acceptable tradeoff for battery

## [1.6.4] - 2026-04-11

Second QA audit pass. v1.6.3 covered hot files from the v1.6.2 stabilization diff; this round audited everything else (main view model, repositories, location services, utilities, theme, wallpaper, icon packs). 22 findings were raised, 20 were verified as false positives and rejected, and 2 latent bugs were confirmed and fixed.

### Fixed
- **AirQuality hourly list empty for distant locations** — `AirQualityRepository` was comparing Open-Meteo hourly timestamps (returned in location-local time when `timezone=auto` is set) against the device's `LocalDateTime.now()`. For users viewing a location in a different timezone (e.g. a phone in Denver looking at Tokyo weather), the filter `!t.isBefore(now.minusHours(1))` dropped every hour in the response, leaving the hourly AQI and 5-day daily AQI cards blank. The repository now anchors "now" off `response.current.time` (parsed as location-local) instead of the device clock. Pollen hourly fallback uses the same anchor.
- **Settings screen main-thread icon pack discovery** — `SettingsViewModel` computed `availableIconPacks` at construction by calling `IconPackManager.getAvailablePacks()`, which reaches into every installed third-party icon-pack APK via `PackageManager.getResourcesForApplication()` + `AssetManager.open()`. That's blocking disk I/O on the main thread — a StrictMode violation that could hitch the first frame of the Settings screen on slow storage or with many packs installed. Now exposed as a `StateFlow<List<IconPack>>` computed on `Dispatchers.IO`; `SettingsScreen` consumes it via `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`. Initial state is an empty list so the UI isn't blocked on discovery.

### Audit findings rejected (with verified reasons)
| Claim | Verdict |
|---|---|
| `MainViewModel.loadWeatherForCoords` default-arg race | Single-threaded on `Dispatchers.Main.immediate` |
| `fetchWeather` default-arg race | Same; only caller passes the arg explicitly |
| `fetchYesterdayComparison` missing `withContext(IO)` | `WeatherRepository.getYesterdayWeather` already wraps in IO |
| `AlertRepository` silently swallows adapter exceptions | Intentional partial-failure pattern |
| Freenet `LocationProvider` listener leak | `LocationManagerCompat.getCurrentLocation` + `CancellationSignal` is the documented pattern |
| `DrivingConditionEvaluator` black-ice at ≤2°C is wrong | Intentional NWS-recommended safety margin for bridge decks / shaded spots |
| `HealthAlertEvaluator` `>` vs `>=` off-by-one | Pedantic; thresholds are advisory, not medical |
| `PetSafetyEvaluator` pavement formula runs at night | Guarded by `if (current.isDay && current.cloudCover < 50)` — audit misread |
| `MeteoconMapper` non-exhaustive | Has fall-through default |
| `WeatherWallpaperService` Handler lifecycle unsafe | Correctly guards with `visible` flag + `removeCallbacks` |
| `MainActivity` sync deep-link | Simple URI parsing, acceptable |
| `WeatherFormatter.feelsLikeReason` hardcoded Celsius threshold | Computed on canonical metric; display unit doesn't enter |
| `WeatherSummaryEngine` not DI-injected | Stateless Kotlin `object` — DI adds nothing |
| `WeatherWallpaperService` raw Int weather code | `WeatherEffect.fromWmoCode` has `else -> CLEAR` default |
| `MainViewModel` mutable props should be state | Internal tracking, not UI state |
| `ClothingSuggestionEvaluator.weatherCode.isRainy` null safety | Enum property, not nullable |
| `AlertRepository` timezone-to-country fallback | Best-effort only; primary path is Geocoder |
| `SavedLocationMatchingTest` robustness | Tests verify the behavior contract |
| `WeatherSummaryEngine` `hourly.isEmpty()` unsafe | `hourly.take(12)` on empty list is safe |
| `GravitySensor` capture clarity | Working as designed |

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-11

Post-v1.6.2 QA audit. Fixes four latent bugs uncovered by a full senior-dev / UX / QA review of the v1.6.2 stabilization pass.

### Fixed
- **Widget ANR risk** — `NimbusWidgetReceiverBase.onDisabled()` and `onDeleted()` previously ran DataStore suspend calls inside `runBlocking { }` on the main thread, which can trigger an ANR if DataStore or WorkManager is slow. Now wraps the cleanup with `goAsync()` and executes it on `Dispatchers.IO`, then calls `pending.finish()` — up to ~10 s of safe background work per broadcast.
- **Locale-dependent saved-location dedupe** — `SavedLocationMatching.normalizeLocationToken` used default-locale `lowercase()`, which is unstable across devices (Turkish dotless-i in particular: `"I".lowercase(tr) == "ı"`, not `"i"`). The new implementation decomposes the string to Unicode NFD, strips combining marks, then `lowercase(Locale.ROOT)`. `"Paris"` now dedupes against `"París"` (different diacritics from different geocoding sources), and `"Istanbul"` / `"istanbul"` match on Turkish-locale devices.
- **Radar frame refresh stuck on NTP rollback** — `shouldLoadRadarFrames()` used `nowMillis - lastLoadedAt >= interval`, which stays `false` when the wall clock rolls backward (e.g. NTP adjustment shortly after boot). The predicate now also treats a negative delta as "stale", so a clock correction can't leave the user staring at old radar frames for up to 5 minutes.
- **Settings permission banner not reactive** — the "Notification Permission Off" card in `SettingsScreen` was computed from a one-shot `hasNotificationPermission(context)` snapshot. If the user left the app, granted POST_NOTIFICATIONS via Android Settings, and came back, the card stayed visible until some other recomposition. The screen now subscribes to the lifecycle and re-reads the permission on `ON_RESUME`, and the in-app permission launcher updates the state directly from its `granted` callback.

### Tests
- `SavedLocationMatchingTest` — covers coordinate-epsilon matching, current-location exclusion, diacritic-insensitive label matching (`Paris` / `París`), and Turkish-locale stability (`Istanbul` / `istanbul` on `tr-TR`).
- `RadarViewModelTest.shouldLoadRadarFrames forces refresh when clock rolls backward` — NTP-rollback regression guard.

### Audit notes
Four additional issues flagged by the audit were verified against the code and rejected as false positives: MainScreen tab normalization, `CompareViewModel.activeLoads` "race" (all on `viewModelScope.launch` = `Dispatchers.Main.immediate`), BlitzortungService WebSocket threading (OkHttp handles it), and ConnectivityObserver "captive portal too strict" (requiring `NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED` is correct for a network-dependent weather app). See the commit message for full rationale.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Notification permission UX** — Settings now gates alert and persistent weather notification toggles behind a runtime POST_NOTIFICATIONS prompt on Android 13+, with a PermissionNoticeCard explaining the requirement.
- **Permission-aware startup** — NimbusApplication reschedules alert/notification workers based on current toggle state instead of blindly launching them, with workers injected through a new `@DefaultDispatcher` Hilt qualifier.
- **Per-widget display labels** — WidgetDataProvider now persists a dedicated `displayLocationName` per appWidgetId so different widgets can share a coordinate and still show the label the user chose.
- **Coordinate-grouped widget refresh** — new `WidgetRefreshPlan` / `buildWidgetRefreshPlan()` pipeline deduplicates saved locations across widgets, fetches each unique coordinate once, and fans results back out to every assigned widget.
- **Orphaned widget cleanup** — stale widget mappings for appWidgetIds that no longer exist are now pruned automatically during refresh.
- **Alert dedupe by coordinate** — AlertCheckWorker collapses saved locations that share the same coordinate (4dp precision) so the same severe-weather alert no longer fires twice.
- **Saved-location duplicate prevention** — new `SavedLocationMatching` utility (epsilon 0.0001° + normalized label) blocks duplicate inserts in LocationRepository and hides already-saved matches from the search results list.
- **Current-location anchoring** — current location is now pinned at `sortOrder = -1` across `addLocation`, `reorderLocations`, and `ensureCurrentLocation` so drag-reorder can never demote it.
- **Widget-config current-location hiding** — the "saved locations" picker in the widget config screen now hides the current-location row so users don't accidentally re-pick it as a saved choice.
- **Radar frame throttle** — RadarViewModel caches the last successful frame load and skips redundant fetches within a 5-minute window via `shouldLoadRadarFrames()` / `canAnimateRadarPlayback()` guards.
- **Radar status overlay** — RadarScreen renders a `RadarStatusCard` for loading/error states, disables playback controls when no frames are available, and hides the community-report FAB when offline or without a valid location.
- **Compare slot state** — CompareViewModel now uses an explicit `Slot { PRIMARY, SECONDARY }` enum plus request-token + active-load counter so a fast location swap can't leave stale weather in the other slot.
- **Connectivity validation** — ConnectivityObserver now requires both `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET` and either `NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED` or a VPN transport before reporting online.
- **Configurable weather cache TTL** — WeatherRepository exposes a user-configurable cache TTL (default 30 min, via `DEFAULT_CACHE_MAX_AGE_MS`) instead of the fixed 6-hour cap, and uses the proper `reverseGeocode()` API for coordinate lookups.
- **Tablet tab normalization** — MainScreen hides the Radar tab on tablets (split pane already shows radar) and auto-corrects the selected tab via `visibleMainTabs()` / `normalizeSelectedMainTab()` so rotation can't leave an invalid selection.
- **Expanded test coverage** — new unit tests for `LocationRepository`, `AlertCheckWorker`, `WeatherRepository`, `CompareViewModel`, widget refresh/config logic, radar screen logic, and locations/main screen logic.

### Fixed
- Race in CompareScreen where swapping primary/secondary locations mid-fetch could overwrite the new slot with the old slot's data.
- Radar playback controls rendering before a frame set was available, producing a broken transport UI on first load.
- BlitzortungService no longer re-creates its CoroutineScope on disconnect; uses field-level scope + `tryEmit` to avoid dropped emissions and job leaks.
- Widget refresh no longer hammers the network when multiple widgets point at the same coordinate, and respects low-battery (<=15%) without returning `Result.retry()` unnecessarily.
- AlertNotificationHelper now only marks alerts as "seen" when they were actually notified, instead of every fetched alert.
- LocationsScreen drag threshold is computed in real pixels via `LocalDensity` instead of a hardcoded float, fixing drag calibration on high-density screens.
- MainActivity and WearMainActivity migrated to lifecycle-aware `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` to stop collecting state in the background.
- ApiKeyField in Settings now commits on focus-loss with a "Saved when you leave the field" hint + proper IME action handling, ending the silent-save bug.
